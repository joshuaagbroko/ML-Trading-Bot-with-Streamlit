# 🤖 Automated Trading Bot with ML & Streamlit

This project is a complete machine learning-driven trading strategy powered by [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/), Streamlit, and scikit-learn. It uses historical stock data to generate trading signals based on technical indicators, trains an ML model, backtests the strategy, and visualizes everything in an interactive dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Real-time price data fetching via OpenBB
- 🧠 ML model training using Random Forest
- 🔧 Technical feature engineering (RSI, SMA, volatility, etc.)
- 🏷️ Custom labeling based on forward returns
- 📈 Strategy backtesting with equity curve vs. benchmark
- 📊 Performance metrics (Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, etc.)
- 🖥️ Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
